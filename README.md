# Wine-Quality-Prediction-Using-Decision-Trees
This project predicts wine quality using decision trees based on physicochemical properties of white wine. Features like acidity, alcohol content, and pH are used to train the model. The R script trains and evaluates the model, visualizes the decision tree, and calculates prediction accuracy.
